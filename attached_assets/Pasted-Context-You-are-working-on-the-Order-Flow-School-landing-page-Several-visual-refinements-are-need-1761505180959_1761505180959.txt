Context:

You are working on the Order Flow School landing page.
Several visual refinements are needed for consistency, proportion, and readability across devices.

The key areas to update are:

The Before/After transformation boxes on mobile.

The Skills Mastery Grid section (Reading the Tape, Absorption & Exhaustion, Volume Profile Mastery, Footprint Chart Precision, etc.).

The removal of the “Why Learn From Me” section since it is duplicated elsewhere on the page.

No code is required — just clear, structured, design and layout adjustment instructions.

Part 1 – Before/After Section (Mobile)
Current Issue:

Text on mobile feels slightly small and not perfectly centered.

Uneven spacing from top and bottom edges.

“Before” and “After” labels not equally aligned or emphasized.

Goal:

Make the text larger and absolutely centered — equal spacing top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
Ensure “AFTER” remains visually dominant (bold) while preserving brand style.

Instructions:

Text Alignment:

Center text both vertically and horizontally inside each container.

Equal spacing from all sides (top, bottom, left, right).

Keep divider line perfectly centered between the “Before” and “After” sections.

Typography:

Increase all text sizes by 20–25% relative to current mobile size.

Maintain Montserrat / Lato font pairing.

Keep “AFTER” label bold and slightly more saturated gold for visual emphasis.

Spacing & Proportion:

Maintain uniform vertical rhythm — all cards the same height.

Add balanced padding for even visual breathing room.

Test at all mobile widths (768, 640, 480 px) to ensure perfect alignment and scaling.

Visual Aesthetic:

Keep ivory background, gold accent lines, and maroon text.

No drop shadows — clean and cinematic.

Part 2 – Skills Mastery Grid (Attached Section)
Current Issue:

Text in this section appears too small on desktop and mobile.

Headings and body text could use better proportional sizing for readability and emphasis.

Goal:

Increase the overall font size hierarchy for both titles (Reading the Tape, Absorption & Exhaustion, etc.) and descriptions to make them stand out visually and feel more premium.

Instructions:

Typography Scaling:

Increase headings by approximately 15–20% in size.

Increase body text/descriptions by 10–15% for improved readability.

Maintain proportional spacing between headings, text, and numbering circles (01, 02, etc.).

Font Weight & Color:

Keep headings in Montserrat Bold, gold color (#F2C14E).

Descriptions remain Lato Regular or Montserrat Regular in ivory (#F6EDE1).

Layout & Proportion:

Keep equal box dimensions and spacing between all four cards.

Maintain perfect proportionality on desktop and mobile view.

Ensure line length remains readable (avoid text stretching too wide).

Visual Harmony:

Preserve brand palette:

Background: deep maroon (#400000 → #630000 gradient).

Gold headings, ivory body text.

Keep numbering circles (01–04) proportionate and aligned with updated font sizes.

Part 3 – Section Removal
Instruction:

Completely remove the “Why Learn From Me” section from the landing page.

This section is already covered in another area and currently creates unnecessary repetition.

Ensure its removal does not affect spacing between surrounding sections — padding and transitions should remain visually consistent.

Final Outcome:

The Before/After boxes are perfectly centered, visually balanced, and easy to read on all mobile devices.

The Skills Mastery Grid text is larger, more legible, and cinematic, matching the overall brand tone.

The “Why Learn From Me” section is cleanly removed, resulting in a more focused, professional flow.

All updates maintain full brand identity consistency (maroon, gold, ivory color palette, geometric typography, minimalist aesthetic).

✅ Deliverable Expectation:
Codex should implement all layout, typography, and proportional adjustments described above — ensuring the mobile and desktop experiences are refined, centered, and consistent with the institutional aesthetic of Order Flow School.
