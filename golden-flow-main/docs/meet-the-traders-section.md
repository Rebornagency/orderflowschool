# Meet the Traders Behind Order Flow School — Section Blueprint

## Purpose
Establish immediate trust by presenting Order Flow School as the product of a disciplined collective of institutional traders. The section reinforces legitimacy right before checkout by showcasing the team, their experience, and mission with restrained confidence.

## Placement
Position between the existing trust-guarantee module and the FAQ (or directly above the checkout module if it appears later in the funnel). Ensure the section stretches the full viewport width with generous top and bottom padding (120px desktop / 96px tablet / 72px mobile) so it feels like a cinematic interlude.

## Visual Treatment
- **Background:** Deep maroon gradient (#400000 → #630000) with a subtle radial spotlight centered on the team grid. Apply a soft vignette on the edges to maintain focus.
- **Typography:**
  - Section Title: Montserrat Bold, 48px desktop / 36px tablet / 28px mobile, gold (#F2C14E).
  - Subheadline: Montserrat SemiBold, 24px desktop / 20px tablet / 18px mobile, ivory (#F6EDE1).
  - Description & list items: Lato Regular, 18px desktop / 16px tablet / 15px mobile, ivory (#F6EDE1) with 150% line-height for readability.
- **Accents:** Thin gold dividers (1px) flanking the headline and under the optional CTA. Use gold corner details or subtle borders around cards (1px, 30% opacity) to convey premium precision without overpowering the layout.
- **Imagery:** Abstract silhouettes or geometric avatars representing traders. Use minimal outlines, angled shoulders, and subtle gold glows to avoid generic stock imagery while evoking professionalism.

## Layout Structure
```

[ Team Grid (3 columns desktop / 1 column mobile) ]

```

### Container
- Max-width 1200px content wrapper, center aligned, with 40px horizontal padding on desktop, 24px tablet, 20px mobile.
- Equal spacing of 48px between typographic blocks (title → subheadline → description → list → grid → CTA).

### Credibility Points Row
- Display as horizontally aligned pill-style badges on desktop: gold stroke (1px), transparent fill, rounded corners (32px), 12px vertical padding, 18px horizontal padding.
- On tablet/mobile, stack vertically with 16px spacing.
- Icons rendered as minimalist line icons (emoji or vector) in gold, followed by text in ivory.

### Team Grid Cards
- Three columns on ≥1024px; two columns on 768–1023px; single column <768px.
- Each card includes:
  1. Abstract avatar (80px circular silhouette with soft gold outer glow, centered at top).
  2. Name placeholder (e.g., “Alex Rivera”) — Montserrat SemiBold, 20px, gold.
  3. Role tagline (e.g., “Institutional Trader — Futures Division”) — Lato Regular, 16px, ivory.
  4. Micro-copy (two lines max) emphasizing expertise (e.g., “Steered order flow desks through high-volatility sessions; codified our auction playbook.”)
- Card background: deep maroon slightly lighter than section base (#4A0808) with inner shadow to create depth; 24px corner radius; 24px padding; maintain consistent card height by limiting text to ~70 words.

### Optional CTA
- Centered line of copy: “Learn the method trusted by those who see what others can’t.” in Montserrat SemiBold, 18px, ivory.
- Underline with a thin gold rule (40px width, centered) to suggest clickability if converted to a button later.

## Copy Deck
- **Title:** “Meet the Traders Behind Order Flow School”
- **Subheadline:** “Built by a team of institutional traders who understand how the markets really move — now sharing their process with the next generation of professionals.”
- **Short Description:** “Our team has spent years executing in institutional environments — analyzing order flow, liquidity, and auction dynamics at the highest level. The Order Flow Guide condenses that experience into a clear, actionable framework any trader can use.”
- **Credibility Points:**
  - 💼 Former institutional & proprietary traders
  - 🧠 Experts in order flow, volume profile & auction theory
  - 📊 Developed tools and processes used by top firms
  - 🎯 Focused on teaching real-world execution and clarity
- **CTA:** “Learn the method trusted by those who see what others can’t.”

## Interaction & Motion Suggestions
- Fade-up animation (200ms delay) for the title and subheadline, followed by staggered card reveals (150ms offset per card) to simulate a curated introduction.
- Subtle hover state on cards: increase gold glow intensity and shift card upward by 4px to imply interactivity while preserving elegance.

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Maintain minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text against backgrounds (gold text on maroon exceeds this threshold; ivory on maroon should be validated and adjusted if necessary).
- Ensure all text remains within two lines to prevent overflow on mobile. Use responsive typography scale with clamp values.
- Provide `aria-label` descriptions for avatar silhouettes (e.g., “Abstract portrait representing Alex Rivera, Institutional Trader”).

## Implementation Notes
- Use CSS Grid for the team layout, switching to a single column via media queries below 768px.
- Leverage existing Tailwind or component system tokens for spacing if available; otherwise, define new utilities aligning with current design language.
- Keep imagery vector-based (SVG) for crisp rendering across devices.

## Success Criteria
- Section visually aligns with Order Flow School’s cinematic aesthetic and color system.
- Visitors immediately understand that Order Flow School is created by a collective of seasoned institutional traders.
- Layout remains balanced and readable across breakpoints, contributing to higher perceived trust near the conversion point.
